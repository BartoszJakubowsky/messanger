This is a simple app to get used to with [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) and it's technologies:
- [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/),
- [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/)
- [**tRPC**](https://trpc.io/)
- [**Prisma**](https://www.prisma.io/)
- [**NextAuth**](https://next-auth.js.org/)
- [**Ably**](https://ably.com/)

Due to way of work messanger's like applications, i implemented  [**Ably**](https://ably.com/) for real time messages experience ðŸ’¬
